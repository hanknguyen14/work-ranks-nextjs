# WORLD RANKS - NEXTJS & TAILWIND CSS

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/hanknguyen14/work-ranks-nextjs.git
cd work-ranks-nextjs
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
